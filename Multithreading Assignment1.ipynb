    "Multithreading in Python is a mechanism that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread operates independently but shares the same memory space with other threads within the same process. Threads are used to achieve concurrent execution and can be particularly useful for tasks that are I/O-bound, such as handling multiple client requests in a server.\n",

    "run(): This is a method that you can override in a custom thread class to specify the code that the thread should execute. It's the actual entry point for the thread's execution. You define the behavior you want the thread to have in this method. When you create a custom thread class and instantiate it, calling the start() method on the instance will eventually call the run() method with the specified behavior for the thread.\n",

    "start(): This method is used to start the execution of a thread. When you call start() on a thread instance, it sets up the necessary internal structures, invokes the run() method (if you've overridden it), and begins the execution of the thread in a separate control flow. It's important to note that start() must be called to initiate a thread's execution. You should never call run() directly, as it will run the thread's code in the current thread's context without any actual concurrency.\n",

    "join(): This method blocks the calling thread until the thread it's called on finishes its execution. Essentially, it waits for the specified thread to complete before the calling thread continues executing. This is useful when you want to ensure that certain threads have finished their tasks before the main program exits or before continuing with further processing.\n",

    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which simplifies sharing data and communication between threads compared to separate processes.\n",

    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the true parallel execution of threads within a single process, especially in CPU-bound tasks. This means that even though you use threads, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time due to the GIL.\n",

    "Complexity: Multithreading can introduce complexity, particularly when dealing with shared resources. Proper synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores are needed to avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks.\n",

    "Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more challenging due to the non-deterministic behavior of threads. Issues like timing-related bugs can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Contention: If not managed properly, threads might compete for system resources, leading to contention issues that can degrade performance rather than improve it.\n",
